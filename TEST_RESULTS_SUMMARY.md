### **⚠️ FRONTEND ROUTING ISSUES**

2. **Vercel Deployment**: Missing `vercel.json` or `_redirects` file  
3. **Build Configuration**: SPA routing not configured

**Required Fix**: Add Vercel SPA configuration:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/.*", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```
